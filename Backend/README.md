# Backend Code
As this subject is about the mobile development, we decide to utilitize Google Firebase as the backend so we can focus more on the front end Android development.

## Language of Choice
From the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started?authuser=1), we know that Firebase Cloud Functions provide two options: `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`.

As `Typescript` is a more type-stricted OO language, we will use `Typescript` as the language for the backend.
